            <h1>Welcome to Happy Bear Friends</h1>
            <p>We are a Non-Profit based in Irvine, California and we focus on kid-friendly toys made from all natural environment-friendly materials.
            We hope to bring awareness to rare animals that not a lot of people have heard of, and then turn these animals into plushies with the goal
            of educating children about these animals.</p>

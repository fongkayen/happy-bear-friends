                            of our products is its selling point and the cassowary plushie is no different. The fur is made from 
                            organic cotton hand-sown by our master craftsmen.</td>

                        including shoots and grass seeds, in addition to fungi, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Cassowaries are very shy, 
                        but when provoked they are capable of inflicting injuries, occasionally fatal, to dogs and people.</td>

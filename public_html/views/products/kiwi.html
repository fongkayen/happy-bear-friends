                    <td class="desc-right animal-desc">Kiwi or kiwis are flightless birds native to New Zealand, in the genus Apteryx and family 
                        Apterygidae. Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist 
                        of ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries), and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird 
                        in the world. The unique adaptations of kiwi, such as their large eggs, short and stout legs, or using their nostrils at 
                        the end of their long beak to detect prey before they ever see it, have helped the bird to become internationally 
                        well-known.</td>
